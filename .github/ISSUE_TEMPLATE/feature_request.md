<!--

Thanks for submitting a feature request for Stork! Stork is *very much* accepting feature requests, and I appreciate all suggestions. Your feature will go onto my list and I'll get to it when I have time, probably.

Before submitting a feature request, please:

- Look at the [project roadmap](https://stork-search.net/roadmap) to see where Stork is going, what features are coming down the pipeline, and what I hope to accomplish
- Look at the [existing feature issues](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature+) to make sure the feature you're requesting hasn't already been requested.

Thanks!
James
