I've been lucky enough to be able to talk about [Stork Search](https://stork-search.net) in two different settings this month!

# console.dev

The first was a [developer interview as part of console.dev's Q&A series](https://console.dev/qa/stork-search-james-little/). In this series, founders David and Max expand on entries in their [developer tools newsletter](https://console.dev) by talking to the people who build these tools to learn more about the project and about how they work. It was a really fun interview, and I got to talk about my desk setup a bit and nerd out about the tools I use, which was fun!

# fission.codes


The second was a [presentation as part of fission.codes' tech talk series](https://vimeo.com/529898007). In this hour-long talk, I presented Stork to an audience of mostly the [fission.codes](https://fission.codes) team, but also to a few guests! I talked about the backstory of the project, about the niche which Stork occupies and the problem it's trying to solve, and I got to deep-dive into the architecture of the code. I ended up putting the slides and a text version of the talk [on a new section of this site](https://jameslittle.me/talks/stork).

I'm really grateful for both opportunities to talk about Stork! Thanks to David (from console.dev) and Boris (from Fission) for reaching out and giving me a place to speak.
