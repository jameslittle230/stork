00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,809
In the next chapter, about Taylor series,
I make frequent reference to higher order

2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:09,809
derivatives.

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,130
And, if you’re already comfortable with
second derivatives, third derivatives and

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,340
such, great!

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,050
Feel free to skip right ahead to the main
event now, you won’t hurt my feelings.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,680
But somehow I’ve managed not to bring up
higher order derivatives at all so far this

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,619
series, so for the sake of completeness, I
thought I’d give this little footnote to

8
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:29,090
very briefly go over them.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,510
I’ll focus mainly on the second derivative,
showing what it looks like in the context

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,180
of graphs and motion, and leave you to think
about the analogies for higher orders.

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:46,060
Given some function f(x), the derivative can
be interpreted as the slope of its graph above

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,700
some input, right?

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,370
A steep slope means a high value for the derivative,
a downward slope means a negative derivative.

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,480
The second derivative, whose notation I’ll
explain in a moment, is the derivative of

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,260
the derivative, meaning it tells you how that
slope is changing.

16
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,240
The way to see this at a glance is to think
of how the graph of f(x) curves.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,500
At points where it curves upward, the slope
is increasing, so the second derivative is

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,980
positive.

19
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,750
At points where it curves downward, the slope
is decreasing, so the second derivative is

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,200
negative.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:33,000
For example, a graph like this has a very
positive second derivative at the input 4,

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,450
since the slope is rapidly increasing around
that point, whereas a graph like this still

23
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,220
has a positive second derivative at that same
point, but it’s smaller, since the slope

24
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,759
is increasing only slowly.

25
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,630
At points where there’s not really any curvature,
the second derivative is zero.

26
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:59,350
As far as notation goes, you could try writing
it like this, indicating some small change

27
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,100
to the derivative function divided by some
small change to x, where as always the use

28
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,369
of that letter d suggests that you really
want to consider what this ratio approach

29
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,099
as dx, both dx’s in this case, approach
0.

30
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:22,849
That’s pretty awkward and clunky, so the
standard is to abbreviate it as d2f/dx2.

31
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:28,969
It’s not terribly important for getting
an intuition of the second derivative, but

32
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:34,069
perhaps it’s worth showing how you can read
this notation.

33
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,709
Think of starting at some input to your function,
and taking two small steps to the right, each

34
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,170
with a size dx.

35
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,129
I’m choosing rather big steps here so that
we’ll better see what’s going on, but

36
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:50,989
in principle think of them as rather tiny.

37
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:56,819
The first step causes some change to the function,
which I’ll call df1, and the second step

38
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:03,459
causes some similar, but possibly slightly
different change, which I’ll call df2.

39
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:10,170
The difference between these; the change in
how the function changes, is what we’ll

40
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,129
call d(df).

41
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:17,790
You should think of this as really small,
typically proportional to the size of (dx)2.

42
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:30,299
So if your choice for dx was 0.01, you’d
expect this d(df) to be proportional to 0.001.

43
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,599
And the second derivative is the size of this
change to the change, divide by the size of

44
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,599
(dx)2.

45
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:43,239
Or, more precisely, it’s whatever that ratio
approaches as dx approaches 0.

46
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,640
Even though it’s not like the letter d is
a variable being multiplied by f, for the

47
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:56,500
sake of more compact notation you write this
as d2f/dx2, and you don’t bother with any

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,370
parentheses on the bottom.

49
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,209
Maybe the most visceral understanding of the
second derivative is that it represents acceleration.

50
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,980
Given some movement along a line, suppose
you have some function that records distance

51
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,409
traveled vs. time, and maybe its graph looks
something like this, steadily increasing over

52
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:16,790
time.

53
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,560
Then its derivative tells you velocity at
each point in time, right?

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,940
For the example, the graph might look like
this bump, increasing to some maximum, then

55
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,150
decreasing back to 0.

56
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,930
So its second derivative tells you the rate
of change for velocity, the acceleration at

57
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,080
each point in time.

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,720
In the example, the second derivative is positive
for the first half of the journey, which indicates

59
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,849
indicates speeding up.

60
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:44,220
That’s sensation of being pushed back into
your car seat with a constant force.

61
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,860
Or rather, having the car seat push you with
a constant force.

62
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,000
A negative second derivative indicates slowing
down, negative acceleration.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,870
The third derivative, and this is not a joke,
is called jerk.

64
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:06,340
So if the jerk is not zero, it means the strength
of the acceleration itself is changing.

65
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,729
One of the most useful things about higher
order derivatives is how they help in approximating

66
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:16,750
functions, which is the topic of the next
chapter on Taylor series, so I’ll see you

67
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:16,890
there.
